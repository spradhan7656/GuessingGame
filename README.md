## NUMBER GUESSING GAME
The Number Guessing Game Project is a simple game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between a specified range. The player has a limited number of guesses to correctly guess the number. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and the player has the option to play again. The project is a good introduction to programming concepts such as variables, loops, and conditional statements. It can be used as a simple exercise to help beginners learn the basics of programming
